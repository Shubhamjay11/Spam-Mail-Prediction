# Spam-Mail-Prediction
We analyzed machine learning techniques and their application to the field of spam filtering.  The challenges of the machine learning algorithms in efficiently handling the menace of spam was pointed out and comparative studies of the machine learning techniques available in literature was done.

## Introduction

In the era of information technology, information sharing has become very easy and fast. Many platforms are available for users to share information anywhere across the world. Among all information sharing mediums, email is the simplest, cheapest, and the most rapid method of information sharing worldwide. But, due to their simplicity, emails are vulnerable to different kinds of attacks, and the most common and dangerous one is spam. No one wants to receive emails not related to their interest because they waste receivers’ time and resources. Besides, these emails can have malicious content hidden in the form of attachments or URLs that may lead to the host system’s security breaches. Spam is any irrelevant and unwanted message or email sent by the attacker to a significant number of recipients by using emails or any other medium of information sharing. So, it requires an immense demand for the security of the email system. Spam emails may carry viruses, rats, and Trojans. Attackers mostly use this technique for luring users towards online services. They may send spam emails that contain attachments with the multiple-file extension, packed URLs that lead the user to malicious and spamming websites and end up with some sort of data or financial fraud and identify theft. Many email providers allow their users to make keywords base rules that automatically filter emails. Still, this approach is not very useful because it is difficult, and users do not want to customize their emails, due to which spammers attack their email accounts.

## Methodology

In the following sections, creating of dataset, training of learning models, and data preprocessing are explained.

## Data Preprocessing

In machine learning (ML), the preprocessing phrase refers to organizing and managing of raw data before using it to train and test different learning models. In simplistic words, preprocessing is a ML data mining approach that turns raw data into a usable and resourceful structure.

The very first step in the construction of a ML model is preprocessing, in which data from the actual world, typically incomplete, imprecise, and inaccurate owing to flaws and deficient, is morphed into a precise, accurate, and usable input variables and trends 

## Feature Extraction 

Feature extraction is the process of converting a large raw dataset into a more manageable format. Any variable, attribute, or class can be extracted from the dataset during this step, depending on the original dataset.

## Logistic Regression Model

Logistic regression is one of the most popular Machine Learning algorithms, which comes under the Supervised Learning technique. It is used for predicting the categorical dependent variable using a given set of independent variables. Logistic regression predicts the output of a categorical dependent variable. Therefore the outcome must be a categorical or discrete value. It can be either Yes or No, 0 or 1, true or False, etc. but instead of giving the exact value as 0 and 1, it gives the probabilistic values which lie between 0 and 1. Logistic Regression is much similar to the Linear Regression except that how they are used. 

## Conclusion

In this study, we reviewed machine learning approaches and their application to the field of spam filtering. A review of the state of the art algorithms been applied for classification of messages as either spam or ham is provided. The evolution of spam messages over the years to evade filters was examined. The basic architecture of email spam filter and the processes involved in filtering spam emails were looked into. The study uses machine learning  algorithms to detect them. We have to use Logistic Regression Model here. In the study, a translated emails dataset including spam and ham emails is generated from Kaggle. Accuracy, precision, F-measure, and model loss are used as comparative measures to examine performance. In addition, more recent artificial intelligent approaches may also be considered to detect spams.
